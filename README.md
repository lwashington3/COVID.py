A Python version of the Illinois Department of Public Health Data Scraper I created in C#. The old project and its setup can be found [here](https://github.com/lwashington3/illinois_covid_data "https://github.com/lwashington3/illinois_covid_data").
The purpose of creating the Python version was to have a better database for my projects instead of having to use Google Sheets and its API.
